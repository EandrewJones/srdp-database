Developer Manual
================

Here you will find a "how to" developer's manual for doing a number of key tasks ranging from installing the application
on your local machine as well as on a production server all the way to modifying and update the database and API as the project
needs change and grow.

Installation
------------

Installation steps vary depending on whether you're installing the app on a local machine for development and testing or
trying to put it into production. However, regardless of which of these two situations you're in, you'll need to install docker
and docker compose on the machine. Installation instructions for each of these can be found below:

- `Get Docker <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_
- `Install Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_
